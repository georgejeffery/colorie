This is the first in what are minor explorations into a "spiritual revolutionary". There's a few main precepts that I think are necessary to lay out first. To wit:

1 There are more intelligences than the human.  
2 The dead are always with us, and seek interaction.  
3 There are much more of them than there are of us.  
4 We live in a philosophically and spiritually impoverished concept of reality.  
5 Re-enchantment has become a necessity.  
6 Human florishing now depends on re-discovering our interactions with non-human intelligence.
